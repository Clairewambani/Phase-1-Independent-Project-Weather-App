This is a simple weather application that allows users to view current weather information for a default location and search for weather data in different locations.

The app is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it accesses weather data from a public API.

Optional Features:

Temperature Unit Toggle: Users can toggle between different temperature units (e.g., Celsius).
